This current project is aimed to help me develop my skills in writing HTML. To do this I will create a basic recipe website. 
Here I tested my skills in formatting, adding links and images, staging and committing my files using Git commands and pushing my files to Github. 
Next, I tested out my skills in CSS, aiming to improve the feel of the website. I used class, ID and type selectors to change fonts, colours and image dimensions. In some cases I grouped and chained selectors. Additionally, I found new properties to design a button I created which takes the user back to the main page of the website.
