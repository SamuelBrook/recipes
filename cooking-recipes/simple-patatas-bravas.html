        <p>This simple but flavourful traditional dish is a favourite among many Spaniards. Cooked with simple ingredients and with minimal prep time, this dish is perfect for those on a budget or with limited time to spare.</p>
        <p>There's no time to waste so let's get cracking!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>4 large potatos</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of smoked paprika</li>
            <li>Half a teaspoon of black pepper</li>
            <li>Quarter of teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>A sprinkle of parsley</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Vegetable stock</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the potatos by chopping them into small cubes.</li>
            <li>Add olive oil into a frying pan to a depth of half of one of the small potato cubes and heat up the oil on a medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the potato cubes to the oil, cook until they have a golden colour, and drain the oil (while cooking start the next step).</li>
            <li>Cut onions and garlic into very fine pieces.</li>
            <li>Add a thin layer of oil into another pan, add the onion and then after around three minutes add the garlic.</li>
            <li>Prepare 300ml of vegetable stock according to the instructions on the packet</li>
            <li>Once the onions are golden brown, add prepared vegetable stock and mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>At this point you can add the smoked paprika, black pepper and salt to the sauce. Again, stir thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Keep heating the sauce until it is less watery. If you prefer, at this point you can add some flour to thicken the sauce.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce is at the desired thickness, serve the potatos and pour the sauce carefully on top (not all the sauce has to be added at once).</li>
            <li>Garnish with the parsely.</li>
        </ol>
