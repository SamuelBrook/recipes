        <h2 class="baked">A British Classic - Jacket Potato and Beans</h2>
        <p>This British classic is flavourful and filling and is ideal for those looking to make something cheap and fast.</p>
        <p>The mode of preparation is entire up to you: For better texture, prepare in the oven, for speed, heat it up in the microwave.
        You can even mix and match, the choice is yours!</p>
        <p>For a smaller snack, use one potato and half a can of beans, for a larger meal, use two potatoes and a full can of beans.</p>
        <h2 class="baked">Ingredients</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(These are really simple)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 or 2 large baking potatoes</li>
            <li>A teaspoon of olive oil (only if cooked in the oven)</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>A can of baked beans</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="baked">Steps</h2>
        <h3>The potato</h3>
        <p>Start off by deciding if you'd rather cook the potatoes in the oven or in the microwave. If you cook them in the 
            oven the potato will be crispier and the texture is generally better but it takes much more time.</p>
        <p>For both methods, start by punching a few small holes in the potato skin using a fork. If you decide to cook in the oven, drizzle half a teaspoon of olive oil onto the skin of each 
            potato and place in the oven on 190Â°C for around 70 to 80 minutes.</p>
        <p>If you prefer the speed of the microwave, place in the microwave and cook for four minutes on the highest setting, turn the potato over and cook for another three to four minutes.
            You can also crisp the potatoes by finishing them off in the oven for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Once the potato is ready, place on a plate and use a knife to open the potato. Place a cube of butter into the centre of the opened potato and let it melt.</p>
        <h3>The beans</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Empty the can (or half can) into a pan and cook on a low to medium heat until the sauce start to bubble.</li>
            <li>Spoon the beans onto the opened jacket potato.</li>
            <li>Add a touch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>You can also top off your jacket potato with a sprinle of grated cheese</li>
        </ol>
